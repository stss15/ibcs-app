# A1.1.4 · Explain the purposes of different types of primary memory

## Learning intentions
- Distinguish between RAM, ROM, cache (L1/L2/L3), and CPU registers.
- Explain how each memory tier contributes to overall system performance.
- Define and contextualise **cache hits** and **cache misses**.
- Trace how the CPU negotiates data access across the hierarchy.

## Teaching notes
- Use analogy (e.g. bookshelf/workbench) to reinforce memory hierarchy speed vs capacity trade-offs.
- Provide interactive demos (cache visualisers, CPU-Z screenshots) to show real systems.
