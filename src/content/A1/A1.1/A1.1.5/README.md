# A1.1.5 · Describe the fetch–decode–execute cycle

## Learning intentions
- Sequence the stages of fetching, decoding, and executing a machine instruction.
- Identify which registers and buses are active at each stage.
- Explain how control signals originate from the CU to drive the cycle.

## Teaching notes
- Animate the cycle with step-through diagrams or microcode simulations.
- Emphasise pipeline hazards that will be explored later in HL extensions.
