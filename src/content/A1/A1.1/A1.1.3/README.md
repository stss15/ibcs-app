# A1.1.3 · Explain the differences between the CPU and the GPU (HL only)

## Learning intentions
- Compare CPU and GPU design philosophies, including instruction scheduling, core counts, and cache hierarchies.
- Discuss usage scenarios that favour CPUs, GPUs, or hybrid cooperation.
- Evaluate differences in processing power, memory access patterns, and power efficiency.
- Describe how CPUs and GPUs collaborate (task division, data sharing, synchronisation).

## Teaching notes
- Provide benchmarking case studies across general-purpose vs graphics workloads.
- Highlight frameworks for heterogeneous computing (OpenCL, CUDA, DirectCompute).
- Reinforce the idea of choosing the right tool for the computational job.
