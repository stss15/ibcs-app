# A1.1.2 · Describe the role of a GPU

## Learning intentions
- Summarise GPU architectural characteristics that favour massively parallel workloads.
- Connect GPU pipelines to use cases such as video games, AI/ML acceleration, simulations, and rendering.
- Contrast GPU throughput-focused design with CPU latency-focused design at a high level.

## Teaching notes
- Use shader pipeline diagrams to show SIMD-style execution.
- Include contemporary examples (e.g. CUDA, Metal, Vulkan compute) to motivate discussion.
- Prompt students to consider when CPU offloading is beneficial versus unnecessary.
