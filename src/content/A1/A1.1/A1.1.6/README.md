# A1.1.6 · Describe the process of pipelining in multi-core architectures (HL only)

## Learning intentions
- Outline pipeline stages (fetch, decode, execute, write-back) and their concurrency.
- Explain how multiple cores operate independently while sharing caches/memory.
- Discuss benefits and challenges of pipelining: throughput, hazards, synchronisation.

## Teaching notes
- Demonstrate pipeline diagrams with colour-coded instruction flow.
- Connect to real CPU examples (e.g., superscalar, out-of-order execution).
- Set up later discussions on parallel programming and efficiency.
