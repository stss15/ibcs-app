# A1.1.8 · Describe the concept of compression

## Learning intentions
- Differentiate between **lossless** and **lossy** compression strategies.
- Explain examples such as run-length encoding and transform coding (e.g., DCT).
- Evaluate trade-offs between compression ratio, fidelity, and computational cost.

## Teaching notes
- Provide hands-on exercises compressing sample data sets or images.
- Discuss where compression appears in daily student experiences (streaming video, zip files).
