# A1.1 · Computer hardware and operation

## Guiding question
What principles underpin the operation of a computer, from low-level hardware functionality to operating system interactions?

---

### A1.1.1 · Describe the functions and interactions of the main CPU components
- **Units**: arithmetic logic unit (ALU), control unit (CU)
- **Registers**: instruction register (IR), program counter (PC), memory address register (MAR), memory data register (MDR), accumulator (AC)
- **Buses**: address, data, control
- **Processors**: single-core processor, multi-core processor, co-processors
- Provide a **diagrammatic representation** that shows the relationship between these CPU components.

### A1.1.2 · Describe the role of a GPU
- GPU architectures are optimised for executing many parallel operations, making them ideal for graphics pipelines and complex computation.
- Real-world scenarios: high-fidelity video games, artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, physics simulations, large-scale data processing, machine learning.

### A1.1.3 · Explain the differences between the CPU and the GPU (HL only)
- Compare design philosophies, usage scenarios, and architectural differences.
- Consider core counts, clock speeds, memory subsystems, power efficiency, and how CPUs and GPUs collaborate (task division, data sharing, coordinated execution).

### A1.1.4 · Explain the purposes of different types of primary memory
- Memory types: random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), cache (L1, L2, L3), CPU registers.
- Highlight how the CPU interacts with each tier to optimise performance and the importance of cache hits versus cache misses.

### A1.1.5 · Describe the fetch–decode–execute cycle
- Outline the cycle for executing a single machine language instruction.
- Map how memory and registers communicate through the address, data, and control buses.

### A1.1.6 · Describe pipelining in multi-core architectures (HL only)
- Show how instructions move through fetch, decode, execute, and write-back stages.
- Explain parallel execution across cores and how pipelining improves throughput.

### A1.1.7 · Describe internal and external secondary memory storage
- **Internal**: SSD, HDD, embedded multimedia cards (eMMC)
- **External**: SSD, HDD, optical drives, flash drives, memory cards, network attached storage (NAS)
- Match each type to common usage scenarios.

### A1.1.8 · Describe the concept of compression
- Differentiate lossy and lossless techniques (e.g., run-length encoding, transform coding).
- Discuss when compression is used to balance fidelity with storage/bandwidth.

### A1.1.9 · Describe the services in cloud computing
- Services: software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS).
- Compare levels of control, flexibility, and responsibilities across the service models.
