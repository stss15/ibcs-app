# A1.1.1 · Describe the functions and interactions of the main CPU components

## Learning intentions
- Identify the role of the **arithmetic logic unit (ALU)** and the **control unit (CU)**.
- Explain how key **registers** (IR, PC, MAR, MDR, accumulator) orchestrate instruction execution.
- Describe the purpose of the **address**, **data**, and **control** buses.
- Compare processor configurations: single-core, multi-core, and co-processors.
- Produce a labelled diagram that links the specified CPU components and data pathways.

## Teaching notes
- Introduce vocabulary with a block diagram that follows the path of an instruction.
- Highlight how control signals coordinate with memory operations across the buses.
- Relate multi-core/co-processor examples to real-world tasks (e.g. DSP, physics engines).
