# A1.2 · Data representation and computer logic

## Guiding question
How does binary encoding enable computers to represent and manipulate data?

---

### A1.2.1 · Describe the principal methods of representing data
- Represent integers in **binary** and **hexadecimal**.
- Convert between binary/hexadecimal and decimal.
- Convert integers directly between binary and hexadecimal.

### A1.2.2 · Explain how binary is used to store data
- Show how binary patterns encode integers, strings, characters, images, audio, and video.
- Discuss how encoding choices affect storage size and retrieval.

### A1.2.3 · Describe the purpose and use of logic gates
- Explain Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR) and their hardware equivalents.
- Highlight how gates form the building blocks of digital circuits and binary computation.

### A1.2.4 · Construct and analyse truth tables
- Build truth tables for simple logic circuits.
- Link logic diagrams, Boolean expressions, and outputs.
- Use Karnaugh maps and algebraic simplification to minimise expressions.

### A1.2.5 · Construct logic diagrams
- Draw logic diagrams with standard gate symbols.
- Combine gates to perform complex operations and simplify with Boolean algebra rules.
