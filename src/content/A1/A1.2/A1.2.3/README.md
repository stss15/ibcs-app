# A1.2.3 · Describe the purpose and use of logic gates

## Learning intentions
- Explain Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR) and corresponding gate symbols.
- Illustrate how gates combine to implement computation.
- Connect truth tables to simple digital circuits.

## Teaching notes
- Provide breadboard or simulator exercises (e.g., Logisim) to reinforce concepts.
- Emphasise practical uses (ALUs, memory latches, decision logic).
