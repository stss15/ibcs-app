# A1.2.4 · Construct and analyse truth tables

## Learning intentions
- Build truth tables to predict outputs of simple and compound logic circuits.
- Relate logic diagrams and Boolean expressions to their truth tables.
- Use Karnaugh maps or algebraic methods to simplify expressions.

## Teaching notes
- Provide scaffolded exercises progressing from two-input to multi-input circuits.
- Highlight minimisation benefits (fewer gates, lower cost/power).
