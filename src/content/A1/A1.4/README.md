# A1.4 · Translation (HL only)

## Guiding question
How do interpreters and compilers translate high-level code into executable form?

---

### A1.4.1 · Evaluate translation processes
- Compare interpreters, compilers, just-in-time (JIT) compilation, and bytecode interpreters.
- Discuss strengths around error detection, translation time, portability, deployment scenarios.
- Map translation choices to contexts like rapid prototyping, performance-critical systems, and cross-platform development.
