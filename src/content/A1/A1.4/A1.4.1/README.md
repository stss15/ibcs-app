# A1.4.1 · Evaluate the translation processes of interpreters and compilers

## Learning intentions
- Differentiate interpreters, compilers, JIT compilation, and bytecode interpreters.
- Compare error detection, translation time, portability, and deployment workflows.
- Select appropriate translation approaches for rapid development, performance-critical systems, and cross-platform targets.

## Teaching notes
- Demonstrate toolchains (Python interpreter, Java bytecode/JVM, C/C++ compilers, JIT in modern browsers).
- Encourage learners to evaluate pros/cons for hypothetical project briefs.
