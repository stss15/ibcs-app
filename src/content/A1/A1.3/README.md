# A1.3 · Operating systems and control systems

## Guiding question
How do operating systems coordinate hardware resources and support control systems?

---

### A1.3.1 · Describe the role of operating systems
- Operating systems abstract hardware complexities and manage system resources for applications.

### A1.3.2 · Describe operating system functions
- Cover: memory management, file systems, device management, scheduling, security, accounting, graphical user interfaces (GUI), virtualization, networking.

### A1.3.3 · Compare scheduling approaches
- First-come first-served, round robin, multilevel queue, priority scheduling.
- Emphasise optimisation goals such as throughput, responsiveness, fairness.

### A1.3.4 · Evaluate polling versus interrupt handling
- Consider event frequency, CPU overhead, power constraints, predictability, latency, security.
- Real-world examples: input devices, networking, storage, embedded and real-time systems.

### A1.3.5 · Explain multitasking and resource allocation (HL only)
- Describe challenges: task scheduling, resource contention, deadlock prevention, synchronisation.

### A1.3.6 · Describe control system components (HL only)
- Components: controller, sensors, actuators, transducers, control algorithms.
- Distinguish open-loop versus closed-loop feedback systems.

### A1.3.7 · Explain control systems in real-world applications (HL only)
- Examples: autonomous vehicles, HVAC, elevators, washing machines, traffic lights, irrigation, home security, automatic doors.
