# A1.3.4 · Evaluate polling versus interrupt handling

## Learning intentions
- Compare polling and interrupt-driven approaches for event handling.
- Consider factors such as event frequency, CPU overhead, power usage, latency, and security.
- Apply concepts to real-world devices: keyboards, network cards, disk I/O, embedded controllers.

## Teaching notes
- Use timing diagrams to highlight wasted cycles in polling vs responsiveness of interrupts.
- Highlight hybrid approaches (interrupt-driven with occasional polling fallbacks).
