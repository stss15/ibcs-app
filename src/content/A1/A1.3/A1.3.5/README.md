# A1.3.5 · Explain the role of the operating system in managing multitasking and resource allocation (HL only)

## Learning intentions
- Analyse multitasking challenges: scheduling, resource contention, synchronisation, deadlock.
- Explain OS strategies for allocating CPU, memory, and I/O resources among competing processes.
- Discuss mechanisms such as mutexes, semaphores, priority inversion handling.

## Teaching notes
- Use case studies (e.g., scheduling audio/video threads alongside background tasks) to ground discussion.
- Introduce classic problems (Dining Philosophers, Producer/Consumer) that illustrate contention.
