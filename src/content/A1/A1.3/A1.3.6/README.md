# A1.3.6 · Describe the use of control system components (HL only)

## Learning intentions
- Define elements of control systems: controller, sensors, actuators, transducers, control algorithms.
- Differentiate between open-loop and closed-loop systems.
- Explain feedback mechanisms for maintaining desired outputs.

## Teaching notes
- Provide block diagrams of control loops (e.g., thermostat, cruise control).
- Discuss control system reliability, calibration, and failure modes.
