# A1.3.3 · Compare scheduling approaches

## Learning intentions
- Describe scheduling strategies: first-come first-served, round robin, multilevel queue, priority scheduling.
- Evaluate optimisation goals (throughput, responsiveness, fairness) for each approach.
- Relate algorithms to scenarios (interactive desktop, real-time control, batch jobs).

## Teaching notes
- Provide Gantt-chart style exercises where learners simulate scheduling decisions.
- Discuss trade-offs such as starvation, context-switch overhead, and fairness.
