# A1.3.7 · Explain the use of control systems in real-world applications (HL only)

## Learning intentions
- Explore examples of control systems: autonomous vehicles, home thermostats, elevator controllers, washing machines, traffic signals, irrigation, security, automatic doors.
- Evaluate design considerations (safety, response time, redundancy) in each context.
- Connect control systems to ethical and societal impacts (trust, automation, accessibility).

## Teaching notes
- Encourage learners to map control components (sensors/actuators/controllers) for each scenario.
- Link to project-based learning where students design simple control simulations.
