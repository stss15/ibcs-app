# A2.2.1 · Describe the functions and practical applications of network topologies

## Learning intentions
- Explain characteristics of star, mesh, and hybrid topologies.
- Evaluate reliability, scalability, collision domains, and deployment cost for each topology.
- Match topologies to real environments (homes, campuses, enterprises, critical infrastructure).

## Teaching notes
- Provide topology diagrams and encourage learners to annotate strengths/weaknesses.
