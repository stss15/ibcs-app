# A2.2.4 · Explain network segmentation

## Learning intentions
- Describe reasons for segmenting networks: performance, security, congestion reduction, resource allocation.
- Explain techniques including segmentation, subnetting, virtual LANs (VLANs).
- Assess how segmentation supports policy enforcement and fault isolation.

## Teaching notes
- Use packet flow diagrams to show benefits of VLANs and subnets.
- Include scenarios requiring segmentation decisions (e.g., separating lab equipment from admin systems).
