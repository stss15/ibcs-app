# A2.3.4 · Explain how static routing and dynamic routing move data across local area networks (HL only)

## Learning intentions
- Describe static routing procedures, advantages, and disadvantages.
- Describe dynamic routing processes, highlighting convergence, resource usage, maintenance.
- Evaluate when each approach suits network size, complexity, and administrative overhead.

## Teaching notes
- Provide lab configurations demonstrating static routes vs dynamic routing protocols (conceptually, no specific protocol detail required).
