# A2.1.4 · Describe the network protocols used for transport and application

## Learning intentions
- Explain key protocols: TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, DHCP.
- Compare reliability, ordering, and overhead between TCP and UDP.
- Discuss how application-layer protocols rely on underlying transport behaviour.

## Teaching notes
- Show packet traces in Wireshark to illustrate handshake vs connectionless packets.
- Relate protocols to common services (web browsing, streaming, DHCP leasing).
