# B4.1 · Abstract data types (ADTs)

### B4.1.1 · Explain ADT properties and purposes
- Provide high-level descriptions of data structures and supported operations.

### B4.1.2 · Evaluate linked lists
- Compare singly, doubly, circular lists; diagram insert/delete/traverse/search; analyse advantages vs arrays.

### B4.1.3 · Construct linked lists
- Implement basic operations for different list variants.

### B4.1.4 · Explain binary search trees (BSTs)
- Describe insertion, deletion, traversal, search; sketch trees to illustrate structure.

### B4.1.5 · Construct sets as an ADT
- Demonstrate union, intersection, difference, membership tests, subset/superset checks.

### B4.1.6 · Explain ADT mechanics in practice
- Detail hashing, collision resolution, load factors, and how HashMap/HashSet (Java) or dict/set (Python) embody ADTs.
