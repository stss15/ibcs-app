# A3.1.1 · Explain the features, benefits, and limitations of a relational database

## Learning intentions
- Identify key relational features: tables, relationships, primary/composite/foreign keys.
- Articulate benefits: data integrity, consistency, reduced duplication, concurrency control, scalability, security.
- Discuss limitations: big data scaling, rigid schemas, handling hierarchical/unstructured data, design complexity.

## Teaching notes
- Present an ERD example and map features to real tables.
- Encourage critical reflection on when alternative database models may be preferable.
