# A3.2.5 · Explain the difference between normal forms

## Learning intentions
- Define 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF, including terms such as atomicity, unique identification, functional dependencies, partial-key dependencies, and non-key/transitive dependencies.
- Recognise violations of each normal form and propose fixes.

## Teaching notes
- Use step-by-step normalisation exercises moving from unnormalised to 3NF tables.
