# B2.4 · Programming algorithms

### B2.4.1 · Analyse algorithm efficiency
- Calculate Big O time and space complexity; choose algorithms based on scalability.

### B2.4.2 · Implement search algorithms
- Linear search vs binary search; trace behaviour; compare efficiency.

### B2.4.3 · Implement sorting algorithms
- Bubble sort and selection sort; evaluate complexity and use-cases.

### B2.4.4 · Explain recursion (HL only)
- Define recursive structure, strengths, limitations; apply to problems like quicksort, tree traversal.

### B2.4.5 · Construct recursive algorithms (HL only)
- Implement simple, non-branching recursive routines in code.
