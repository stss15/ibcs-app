# B1.1 · Approaches to computational thinking

## Guiding question
How can computational thinking be applied to solve real-world problems?

---

### B1.1.1 · Construct a problem specification
- Include problem statements, constraints, objectives, inputs, outputs, evaluation criteria.

### B1.1.2 · Describe fundamental computational thinking concepts
- Abstraction, algorithmic design, decomposition, pattern recognition.

### B1.1.3 · Explain applying computational thinking to problem-solving
- Emphasise toolkit mindset; apply to software, data analysis, machine learning, database design, network security.

### B1.1.4 · Trace flowcharts
- Use standard symbols (start/end, process, decision, input/output, connectors) to reason about algorithms.
