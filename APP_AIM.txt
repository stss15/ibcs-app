IBCS APP — OVERALL AIM

Purpose
A free, static teaching app for IB Computer Science first exams 2027. Students learn through a gated journey of reading, formative checks, and summative tasks. Teachers unlock topics, track progress, and mark work. The app avoids personal data, paid APIs, and email logins.

Audience
- Students in SL and HL
- Teachers who want simple class control and quick visibility of progress

Core objectives
1. Map the full syllabus A1 to A4 and B1 to B4 into navigable topics and subtopics.
2. Provide interactive items: multiple choice, true or false, gap fill, match pairs, Python code, SQL code, short and long answers.
3. Enforce progression: reading then pass the formative then access the next section then attempt the summative.
4. Offer a teacher dashboard: class roster, locks, progress grid, marking queue, CSV export.
5. Keep data light: first names or usernames only, salted password hashes, signed session tokens.
6. Support SL and HL visibility flags so HL only content is hidden for SL accounts.
7. Include sandboxes: Pyodide for Python and SQLite WASM for SQL with resettable state.

Non goals
- No email based accounts, no OAuth, no AI API usage, no paid services.
- No heavy back end. Only a Worker for auth and safe writes.

Privacy principles
- Only store teacher display names and student first names or usernames.
- Store password hashes not plaintext. Tokens are short lived and signed.
- Students can only read public content and write their own progress. Teachers can modify only their classes.

Definition of done for MVP
- Login works for teacher and student using the Worker.
- Teacher can create a class, add students, and unlock a topic.
- Student can complete a formative and unlock the next section.
- Summative submission stores a grade placeholder and appears in the marking queue.
- Basic CSV export functions.

Roadmap
M1 Core navigation, formative engine, progress storage.
M2 Summatives, marking UI, CSV export.
M3 Code sandboxes for Python and SQL, auto marking for simple cases.
M4 Analytics per class and topic, content authoring GUI, theme and accessibility polish.

Success criteria
- A class can complete an A1 subtopic end to end without staff intervention after unlock.
- Teacher can see live progress and export marks.
- Deployment runs on free tiers only: GitHub Pages, InstantDB, Cloudflare Worker.
