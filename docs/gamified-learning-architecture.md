# Gamified Learning Architecture (Legacy Entry)

This file remains for backward compatibility. All active authoring guidance now lives in the central documentation set.

- ✅ Use [`content-authoring.md`](./content-authoring.md) for the full GamifiedUnit schema, segment catalogue, analytics hooks, and authoring workflow.
- ✅ See [`frontend-architecture.md`](./frontend-architecture.md) for component structure, CSS/JS conventions, and shared utilities.
- ✅ Record schema or workflow changes in [`change-log.txt`](./change-log.txt) whenever you add new segment types or adjust persistence.

Please update external references to point to the new docs.
