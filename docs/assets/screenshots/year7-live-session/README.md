# Year 7 Live Session Screenshot Placeholders

The refactor was executed from a non-GUI environment, so we cannot attach actual renders. Reserve the following filenames when capturing real screenshots in a browser session:

- `teacher-live-session-desktop.png` &mdash; Teacher view, 1440×900, assessment panel expanded with the tokenised stat cards visible.
- `student-live-session-desktop.png` &mdash; Student view, 1280×832, highlighting the join code panel, pointer status badge, and continue CTA.

Store the captured PNGs in this folder and update the P1-012 changelog entry with the capture date once available.
