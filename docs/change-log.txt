IBCS APP — OPERATIONS CHANGE LOG
================================

2025-11-03  Major UI/UX modernization & design system
---------------------------------
- Implemented comprehensive UI/UX overhaul targeting students aged 11-18 with modern, gamified learning experience.
- Created global design system with CSS variables, animations, transitions, and utility classes in `styles/global.css`.
- Enhanced all tables with sticky headers, zebra striping, hover effects, and gradient headers.
- Redesigned keyword definition cards with modern gradients, hover animations, and left border reveals.
- Added celebratory animations to quizzes (checkmarks, X marks, emoji celebrations, pulse/wiggle effects).
- Upgraded all activity components with gradient backgrounds, smooth transitions, and success animations.
- Enhanced XP & gamification system with animated sparkles, shimmer effects, gold gradients, and level badges.
- Modernized Student Dashboard with animated progress rings, gradient metrics, and enhanced hover effects.
- Improved Year 7 Map with visual learning pathways, state-based animations (bounce, wiggle), and completion celebrations.
- Created 8 reusable components in `EnhancedComponents.jsx`: KeywordCard, Callout, EnhancedTable, ProgressIndicator, AchievementBadge, XPNotification, StreakIndicator, SkeletonLoader.
- Added comprehensive documentation: `ui-ux-design-system.md`, `UI-UX-IMPROVEMENTS-SUMMARY.md`, `QUICK-START-GUIDE.md`.
- All changes maintain school brand colors, are fully responsive, WCAG AA compliant, and backward-compatible.

2025-11-05  Python-first curriculum & dashboards
---------------------------------
- Reworked B2.1 curriculum content and supporting docs to use Python exclusively; removed legacy Java guidance.
- Namespaced gamified progress storage per user to prevent cross-account data leakage.
- Enhanced student and teacher dashboards with gamification stats and learner insight panels.
- Introduced the Year 7 teacher-paced curriculum map with live lesson pointer controls.

2025-11-03  Deployment safeguards
---------------------------------
- `deploy-everything.sh` now aborts when not on `main` and fetches `origin/main` to prevent non-fast-forward pushes.
- `seed-teacher.js` auto-fills first/last names (or prompts for them) to satisfy required InstantDB attributes during seeding.

2025-11-03  Docs consolidation
--------------------------------
- Centralised operational guides under `docs/` with new index, setup, architecture, content-authoring, deployment, and AI agent playbooks.
- Added lazy dependency installs and defensive git push handling to `deploy-everything.sh`.
- Archived legacy docs (`AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md`, `initial_setup.txt`, `APP_AIM.txt`) in favour of the new hub.

Notes:
- Update this file whenever workflows, scripts, or architecture guidance changes in a way that affects maintainers or agents.

2025-11-05  Authentication normalisation & lesson UX tidy
----------------------------------------
- Added `usernameLower` fields to InstantDB schema and worker repositories so logins behave case-insensitively across admin, teacher, and student roles.
- Updated Cloudflare Worker auth flows to issue lowercased token usernames and reuse the new fields during verification, bulk student creation, and dashboard lookups.
- Refreshed the lesson detail page to surface migration status, link to active B1/B2 modules, and remove unfinished interactive placeholders.

2025-11-05  Gamified interactions & layout polish
----------------------------------------
- Introduced new activity components (`classification`, `diagram-label`, `code-completion`, `spot-error`) and overhauled ordering/gap-fill interactions for drag-and-drop play.
- Centered stage content with animated transitions, added scroll-to-top behaviour, and expanded attempt badges with per-attempt scoring details.
- Updated B1/B2 unit content to use the richer activities, including diagram labelling, word-bank fill-ins, code completion, and exception handling classification.
