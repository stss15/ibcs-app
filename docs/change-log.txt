IBCS APP — OPERATIONS CHANGE LOG
================================

2025-11-03  Docs consolidation
--------------------------------
- Centralised operational guides under `docs/` with new index, setup, architecture, content-authoring, deployment, and AI agent playbooks.
- Added lazy dependency installs and defensive git push handling to `deploy-everything.sh`.
- Archived legacy docs (`AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md`, `initial_setup.txt`, `APP_AIM.txt`) in favour of the new hub.

Notes:
- Update this file whenever workflows, scripts, or architecture guidance changes in a way that affects maintainers or agents.

2025-11-05  Authentication normalisation & lesson UX tidy
----------------------------------------
- Added `usernameLower` fields to InstantDB schema and worker repositories so logins behave case-insensitively across admin, teacher, and student roles.
- Updated Cloudflare Worker auth flows to issue lowercased token usernames and reuse the new fields during verification, bulk student creation, and dashboard lookups.
- Refreshed the lesson detail page to surface migration status, link to active B1/B2 modules, and remove unfinished interactive placeholders.
