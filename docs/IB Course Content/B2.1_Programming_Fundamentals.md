# Unit B2.1: Programming Fundamentals

**Guiding question:** *How can we apply programming to solve problems?*

---

## Aim of the unit
Learners write, trace, and debug small programs using correct data types, variables, and string operations. They apply defensive techniques for exceptions and use practical debugging workflows.

## Key vocabulary
| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Variable** | Named memory location whose value can change during execution. |
| **Data type** | Defines what values a variable may hold and which operations are valid. |
| **Boolean** | True/False value. |
| **Integer / Float/Double / Char / String** | Whole numbers; decimals; single character; sequence of characters. |
| **Operator** | Symbol performing arithmetic, relational, or logical operations; includes unary and binary forms. |
| **Assignment** | Sets or updates a variable’s value. Previous value is overwritten. |
| **Substring / Slice** | Portion of a string selected by position indexes. |
| **Concatenation** | Joining strings together. |
| **Escape character** | Backslash used to insert quotes, backslash, newlines in strings. |
| **API** | Language library interface describing available methods and usage. |
| **Exception** | Runtime anomaly like bad input or missing resource; handled with try/catch (Java) or try/except (Python). |
| **Debugging** | Techniques to locate and fix logic/syntax/runtime errors. Includes trace tables, breakpoints, prints, step execution. |

## B2.1.1 Variables and data types

### Why it matters
Correct types enable correct operations and performance. Poor choices leak accuracy or break comparisons.

### Core content
- **Declaration & initialization:** State type and give first value (Java); Python infers type.  
- **Scope:** Global vs local affects lifetime and side effects.  
- **Types and examples:** Boolean, Char, Integer, Float/Double, String with platform syntax.  
- **Operators summary:** Arithmetic `+ - * / %`, relational `< <= > >= == !=`, logical `&& || !` (Java) and `and or not` (Python); integer vs floating-point division; unary `++ --`.  
- **Assignment rules:** Right-hand expression evaluated then stored; previous value lost. Swapping requires a temporary variable.  
- **Choosing types:** Impacts memory, precision, and allowed operations.  

### Worked example
- **Choosing types for a form:** name→String, age→int or double (if fractional years matter), price→double, vegan→Boolean, middle initial→Char, phone→String (no arithmetic).

### Mini checkpoints
1) **MCQ:** Best type for “price of ticket”?  
2) **T/F:** A variable can hold multiple values at once.  
3) **Fill-in:** Integer division of `7/2` in Java with ints gives `__`; Python floor division uses operator `__`.  
4) **Short task:** Swap two variables’ values; explain why a temp is needed.

### Reflection
When would you pick `double` instead of `int` for “age”? Justify.

## B2.1.2 Strings: extraction and manipulation

### Why it matters
Most user input is text. Robust programs slice, search, format, and clean strings reliably.

### Core content
- **Common Java methods:** `charAt`, `contains`, `indexOf`, `substring`, `replace`, `replaceFirst`, `replaceAll`, `concat`.  
- **Common Python techniques:** indexing `s[i]`, `find/rfind`, slicing `s[a:b]`, `replace`, `split`, concatenation with `+` and formatting with `str()`, `%`, `.format`, f-strings.  
- **Escape characters and multi-line strings:** `"`, `'`, `\`, `
`; Python triple quotes; Java string building.  
- **Trim/strip:** Remove leading/trailing spaces before processing.  
- **API context:** Official language APIs list full method sets.

### Worked example
- **Initial password generator:** surname slice + special suffix; ensure indexes exist; normalise case.

### Mini checkpoints
1) **Locate:** In `"Old Town"`, what is `charAt(4)` / `s[4]`?  
2) **Substring:** Extract `"Science"` from `"Computer Science is fun"` using start/end indexes.  
3) **Replace:** Turn `"is"` into `"will be"` across the string. Show method used.  
4) **Split:** Tokenise a sentence into words; print each on new line.

### Reflection
When concatenating numbers into strings, which conversion or formatting approach is clearest in your chosen language?

## B2.1.3 Exception handling

### Why it matters
Programs fail on bad input, missing files, or logic errors. Defensive handling prevents crashes and preserves UX.

### Core content
- **Typical failure points:** Unexpected input, unavailable resources (files, libraries, sensors), logic errors.  
- **Handling blocks:** `try/catch` (Java), `try/except` (Python) to intercept exceptions and print helpful messages.  
- **`finally` usage:** Always-execute block to close files or signal safe termination.  
- **Design-time prevention:** Range checks, dropdowns, input validation (e.g., email must contain `@`).

### Worked example
- **Out-of-range index:** Access `pets[5]` when list has 3 items; catch and print readable error; in `finally`, close resources or print “program ended safely.”

### Mini checkpoints
1) **T/F:** `finally` runs only when an exception occurs.  
2) **Identify:** Which error type fits “file not found”? Which block mitigates it?  
3) **Scenario:** Validate user age input is `0–120`. Describe checks.

### Reflection
How does “garbage in, garbage out” influence your validation strategy?

## B2.1.4 Debugging techniques

### Why it matters
Bugs often sit in correct-looking code. Methodical debugging avoids guesswork.

### Core content
- **Trace tables:** Record variable values per step to verify logic. Example counts “warm days > 20°C.”  
- **Breakpoints:** Pause execution to inspect state inside loops/branches.  
- **Print logging:** Print markers and values to trace control flow and variable updates.  
- **Step execution:** Step-in/over with IDE to see the live values and current line.  
- **Apply the right tool:** Wrong totals → trace table; skipped branch → print or breakpoint; input rejected → prints and type checks; broken loop → step execution.

### Worked example
- **Selection sort snippet:** Insert prints at key lines to show `highestIndex` changes; place breakpoints in inner loop; step to confirm swap.

### Mini checkpoints
1) **Complete a trace table** for given loop and input array.  
2) **Explain:** When do you prefer a breakpoint over prints?  
3) **Identify:** Which technique best reveals an off-by-one loop error?

### Reflection
Which bug did you last fix? Which technique found it fastest?

## Consolidation task
Build a **username utility**:
1) Ask for first and last name; generate initial username using last two of first + first three of last; lower-case; validate min lengths.  
2) Add exception handling for short names and non-alpha characters.  
3) Add debug prints or breakpoints; supply a trace table for test cases.
